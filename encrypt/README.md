## 1.1 base64
The base64 is not an encryption algorithm, is an encoding algorithm, the example as:  

![base64](./img/base64_example.png "base64")

With the base64 encoding the length of data will increase 1/3。
The base64 can trans the binary file to text so that the binary file can be treated as a text.

## 1.2 symmetric encryption
The symmtric encryption has several types as:  

![symmetric encryption](./img/symmetric_encryption.png "sysmmetric encryption")

The aes is the popular and safe one.

For aes use CBC can make the cipher text different with the random iv.
